# character_identify
This project aim to recongize characters in a picture of a picture such as an id card or an invoice. The first step is to recongize the char at a fixed location in a picture. This step doesn't involve semantic analysis and only focus on the formatted pictures. In the second step, we will try some picture in which char will not appear in some specific locations.
